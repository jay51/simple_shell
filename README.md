# Simple Shell
A functional shell that works the same as the sh. This Simple Shell will work in both interactive and non-interactive mode.

What is the Shell?

The Shell is a CLI (Command Line Interface) that provides a command based UI for Unix-like operating systems. So in short, this is where we input the commands and we get its respective output.
## Getting Started
The project was written in C programming language. When compiled, it will function as the shell terminal.

**Compilation and Implementation**

After you have cloned this Repo you will compile, using the following flags:
```
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o hsh
```

## Testing
After the Shell is compiled it should work like this in interactive mode:
```
$ ./hsh
($) /bin/ls
hsh main.c shell.c
($)
($) exit
$
```
And also in non-interactive mode:
```
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
$ cat test_ls_2
/bin/ls
/bin/ls
$
$ cat test_ls_2 | ./hsh
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_2
$
```
## Requirements
No more than 5 functions per file

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
